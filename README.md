# Supermarket Sales Dashboard ðŸ“Š

This project is to showcase my incredible 2013 Excel skills! Please give me a newer version.
This project features an Excel and SQL-based dashboard designed to visualize supermarket sales data in multiple ways - we get a couple of different views of sales metrics, top products, category percentages, and more - all helping to analyze trends and performance across different dimensions.

Side note: Excel 2013 does NOT have an area map... unfortunately. 

## Tools & Technologies
- **Excel**: Used for data analysis, processing, and creating visualizations.
- **SQL**: Utilized for querying and managing sales data.

## Project Features
- **Dynamic Visualizations**: Various charts and graphs to display sales data, including trends, totals, and comparisons.
- **Data Insights**: Analyze sales performance by product, category, region, and time period.
- **Interactive Elements**: Filters and slicers to customize views and drill down into specific data points.
Another side note: it is incredibly tedious formatting slicers on Excel 2013.  

## How to Run
1. Open the Excel file.
2. Explore the different visualizations and interact with the filters to gain insights.
3. That is literally it, have fun!
